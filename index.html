    <h1>Hi, My Name is Pedro</h1>
   
 
    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>My name is Pedro, I'm 16 years old and I've been studying programming for 2 years.
        I've always liked programming, I've done several courses and mini projects, but nothing very big 
        or in-depth. I currently study at a technical school, on the Digital Games Programming course, 
        and I am going into my third and final year at the school. In the future I intend to work 
        with programming, as it is an area that I like and do well in.</p> <p>Currently I work with the following 
        programming languages:<br>
        -C#<br>
        -Html<br>
        -Css<br>
        -JavaScript<br>
        -GMD<br>
        
        Some of these languages I am still studying and expanding my knowledge about, in which the languages 
        are Html, CSS, JavaScript</p>

    <h2>Project</h2>
    <p>In addition to this website, I have other projects that 
        I have worked on or am currently working on. They are:</p>
     <h3>Gaia Reset</h3>
     <p>Gaia Reset is a game made for an annual term paper at my current school, the game is based on city 
        management games and exploration of a post-apocalyptic world, in the game we control Gaia, 
        an artificial intelligence made to end pollution that has devastated the planet, 
        it is up to us to take care of our base and the humans still alive and find a solution to save our planet,
        The game is not 100% finished yet, we intend to invest more time in the game and improve it as much as possible.
    </p>   
    <h3>Technologies used</h3>
    <p>To create this project, I used a Game Engine called Unity, 
    the programming language used was C#</p>
    <h3>Link to the project</h3>
    <a href="https://crimson-line-co.itch.io/gaia-reset"class="Link">Game Page</a>
    <h3>Forgotten Traumas</h3>
    <p>Forgotten Traumas is a psychological horror and suspense game, 
        in which you control a girl who lives her life normally, 
        until certain strange events happen and change her life. 
        This game is still very early in its development, 
        unfortunately I don't have much to show about this project, 
        but I intend to update the game's status on my social networks.</p>
        <h3>Technologies used</h3>
    <p>To create this project, I am using the Game Engine called GameMaker Studio 2, 
        the programming language being used is GMD.</p>
